MvcAngularBlog
==============
For past some time I have been seeing so many applications being made by the integration of Asp.Net(Web Forms in particular) and AngularJS, including Asp.Net MVC. So I decided to give it a try and see how the idea of a hybrid application made by using Asp.Net Mvc and AngularJS can work and take a meaningful form. With that being said I would also like you to keep in mind that this is in no way an optimum approach, nor do I encourage mixing two great MVC/MVVM frameworks together and go guns blazing on the hybrid approach. This code is just an attempt to create an application using the two frameworks and to provide a reference to those who are interested in coding something like this.
